# MovBot
**A simple telegram bot that recommends movies to the user based on the preferred language and genre.**

## Introduction 
Telegram has launched a Bot API and platform for third-party developers to create bots. So, what are bots? Bots are simply Telegram accounts operated by software and not people. They can do anything – search, broadcast, remind, connect, integrate with other services, or even pass commands to the Internet of Things.

From Amazon to YouTube, every application tends to use a recommendation system for reaching more users and creating a more personalized feel for a user. In simple terms, recommender systems are algorithms aimed at suggesting relevant items to users (items being movies to watch, text to read, products to buy or anything else depending on industries). 

This project aims to build a simple movie recommendation telegram bot called Movbot – to recommend movies to the user based on the preferred language and genre. The deployment of the telegram bot is on Heroku which is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.
