# MovBot
**A simple telegram bot that recommends movies to the user based on the preferred language and genre.**

## Introduction 
Telegram has launched a Bot API and platform for third-party developers to create bots. So, what are bots? Bots are simply Telegram accounts operated by software and not people. They can do anything – search, broadcast, remind, connect, integrate with other services, or even pass commands to the Internet of Things.

From Amazon to YouTube, every application tends to use a recommendation system for reaching more users and creating a more personalized feel for a user. In simple terms, recommender systems are algorithms aimed at suggesting relevant items to users (items being movies to watch, text to read, products to buy or anything else depending on industries). 

This project aims to build a simple movie recommendation telegram bot called Movbot – to recommend movies to the user based on the preferred language and genre. The deployment of the telegram bot is on Heroku which is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

## Deployment method - Heroku Cloud
Heroku is a cloud platform that lets individuals build, deliver, monitor, and scale apps — the fastest way to go from idea to URL, bypassing all those infrastructure headaches.
Supported Languages are Node.js, Ruby, Java, PHP, Python, Go, Scala.

## Procedure
1. @Bot Father:
    - Generate a key with @BotFather and use a simple https API to control the bot.
    - @Botfather- The bot to rule all other bots. we can use it to create new bot accounts and manage any existing bots you have created.
2. Python Code for a specific application:
    - After receiving the API key, Program the bot with the necessary requirements.
    - Create a Repository in GitHub which is like a directory or storage space where your projects are placed. 
    - Add Requirements.txt, Procfile and runtime.txt to the Repository in GitHub along with the python files.
3. Deployment on Heroku Cloud Application Program:
    - Link our GitHub profile to Heroku.
    - Link our repository to Heroku through GitHub.
    - Deploy the Bot on Heroku Cloud Application Program.

## FUTURE SCOPE:
1. The Telegram bot can be using a larger database to suggest movies to the users.
2. The Bot can be integrated with a recommendation system using memory based collaborative filtering method or Model based collaborative filtering method.
3. The Bot can be integrated with AI and ML algorithms to generate the text responses to the users.
